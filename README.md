## What I Work On

- Authorization control planes
- Developer cognition & workflow systems
- Behavioral engineering for software teams
- Enterprise-ready Node.js infrastructure
- Tourism & AgriTech systems (long-term vision)

I care about structure, versioning, traceability, and decision visibility.

# Projects

## 🛡 Accord
**Policy-first identity & access control platform for Node.js**

Authorization should not live inside scattered conditionals.  
Accord treats access as a *formal agreement* between identities, systems, and resources.

- Platform mode (HTTP control plane)
- Library mode
- Versioned policies
- Rollback & simulation engine
- Decision tracing & observability
- Postgres & file adapters

`npm install @navirondynamics/accord`

→ Built as infrastructure, not middleware.

---

## 👻 Valac
**Behavioral coding telemetry – without reading your code**

Valac tracks *how* you work, not what you write.

- Detects perfection loops (Churn Energy)
- Measures context switching (Drift Energy)
- Identifies mental stalls
- Session-based per project
- No code content stored (privacy-first)

This is cognitive engineering for developers.

---

## 🧠 WorkCTL
**Continuity layer for developers**

Context switching is expensive.  
WorkCTL lets you stop and resume projects without losing mental state.

- Project memory
- Task state tracking
- Start/Stop/Resume flow
- Append-only history

It solves *cognitive loss*, not productivity.

---

## 📚 Accord Developer Content
Official documentation platform for Accord.

- MDX-based interactive documentation
- API references
- Simulation guides
- Governance philosophy

Documentation is part of the system.

---

## Philosophy

- Governance over chaos  
- Version everything  
- Make decisions visible  
- Build for long-term control, not short-term speed  
- Treat authorization and workflow as first-class architecture  

---

## Long-Term Direction

I’m building toward:

- Enterprise-grade policy infrastructure
- Tourism technology platforms
- AgriTech system architecture
- Control planes for SMEs in emerging markets

Under **Naviron Dynamics** — “Look Ahead. Lead Ahead.”
