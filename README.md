---

I design and build structured software systems — focusing on authorization, workflow continuity, and developer tooling.  
My work centers around making complex systems more traceable, governable, and maintainable over time.

---

## Current Projects

🛡 **[Accord](https://github.com/bsen-alt/Accord)** – Policy-first identity & access platform for Node.js.  
Versioned authorization, simulation, rollback, and centralized decision tracing.

👻 **[Valac](https://github.com/bsen-alt/valac)** – Behavioral coding telemetry CLI.  
Tracks churn, drift, and stalls to understand how developers work — without storing code content.

🧠 **[WorkCTL](https://github.com/bsen-alt/WorkCtl)** – Project continuity layer.  
Start, stop, and resume work without losing context or task state.

📚 **[Accord Developer Content](https://github.com/bsen-alt/accord.dev)** – Documentation platform for Accord.  
MDX-based guides, API references, and governance philosophy.

## Philosophy

> “Ship beats perfect.”  
> I build tools to solve my own operational and architectural problems, then refine them into structured systems.  
> Currently exploring how AI and policy engines reshape long-term software governance.
