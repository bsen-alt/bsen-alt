---

I design and build structured software systems - focusing on authorization, workflow continuity, and developer tooling.  
My work centers around making complex systems more traceable, governable, and maintainable over time.

## Current Projects

🛡 **[Accord](https://github.com/bsen-alt/Accord)** - Policy-first identity & access platform for Node.js.  
Versioned authorization, simulation, rollback, and centralized decision tracing.

👻 **[Valac](https://github.com/bsen-alt/valac)** - Behavioral coding telemetry CLI.  
Tracks churn, drift, and stalls to understand how developers work — without storing code content.

🧠 **[WorkCTL](https://github.com/bsen-alt/WorkCtl)** - Project continuity layer.  
Start, stop, and resume work without losing context or task state.

📚 **[Accord Developer Content](https://github.com/bsen-alt/accord.dev)** - Documentation platform for Accord.  
MDX-based guides, API references, and governance philosophy.

## Philosophy

> “I design for control before scale”  
> Systems should make decisions explicit, versioned, and traceable.
> I focus on building systems that reduce ambiguity for developers, for teams, and for businesses operating in uncertain environments.

<details>
<summary>Facts</summary>

- I think in control planes, not features.
- I care more about decision visibility than velocity metrics.
- I design systems assuming they’ll outlive their first use case.
